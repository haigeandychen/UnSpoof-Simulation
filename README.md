# UnSpoof-Simulation

This repository contains the main simulation of our spoofing-free UWB localization work. It's created to study internal attacks in UWB TWR ranging systems and the effectiveness of our spoofing detection method for different anchor topology, ranging noise, detection threshold, and so on.

Code tested in Matlab R2022b and R2023b.
